Forward pass of demon on eurocmav dataset.

Plotting gt vs predicted 3d camera trajectory in matlab.

Also plotting rotation and translation loss in matlab.

Results:
pretty terrible trajectory prediction. output depth is reasonable, but bad.

Future work:
-finetune demon on eurocmav
-rectify image pair before feeding to demon
